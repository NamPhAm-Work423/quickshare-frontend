# About QuickShare

QuickShare is a secure, peer-to-peer file sharing platform that puts privacy and simplicity first. We believe file sharing should be fast, secure, and accessible to everyone without compromising personal data.

## Our Mission

To provide the most secure and private way to share files online, without requiring accounts, storing data on servers, or tracking users.

## How We're Different

### No Account Required
Share files instantly with just a 6-digit code. No email, password, or personal information needed.

### Zero Server Storage
Your files never touch our servers. We only provide the signaling to establish direct peer-to-peer connections.

### End-to-End Encryption
All transfers use WebRTC's built-in encryption. Files are encrypted from your device to the recipient's device.

### Open Source Transparency
Our code is open source, allowing security experts to verify our privacy claims.

## The Technology

QuickShare uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) to create direct connections between browsers. This means:

- **Direct Transfer**: Files go straight from sender to receiver
- **No Middleman**: We can't see, store, or access your files
- **Real-Time**: Transfers happen as fast as your connection allows
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern web browser

## Privacy Commitment

We are committed to protecting your privacy:

- **No File Storage**: Files are never stored on our servers
- **Minimal Logging**: We only log basic connection metadata for debugging
- **No Tracking**: No cookies, analytics, or user tracking
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Session data is automatically deleted after use

## Security Features

- **Single-Use Codes**: Each 6-digit code works only once
- **Time Expiration**: Codes expire automatically for security
- **Connection Encryption**: All data encrypted during transfer
- **No Persistent Storage**: Nothing saved after transfer completes
