# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: December 15, 2025*

At QuickShare, your privacy is not just a policy—it's our core principle. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data (spoiler: we barely collect any).

## Our Privacy Philosophy

We believe in **privacy by design**. Our entire system is built to minimize data collection and maximize your control over your information.

### What We Don't Do
- ❌ Store your files on our servers
- ❌ Track your browsing behavior
- ❌ Sell your data to third parties
- ❌ Require personal information to use our service
- ❌ Use cookies for tracking
- ❌ Keep logs of your file transfers

### What We Do
- ✅ Provide secure P2P file transfer
- ✅ Minimize data collection to essential functions only
- ✅ Automatically delete session data
- ✅ Use encryption for all communications
- ✅ Give you complete control over your data

## Information We Collect

### Essential Technical Data
We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide our service:

**Session Information**
- Unique session IDs (randomly generated)
- Connection timestamps
- Basic error logs for debugging

**Network Information**
- IP addresses (for WebRTC connection establishment only)
- Browser type and version (for compatibility)
- Connection quality metrics (for service improvement)

### What We Don't Collect
- Personal information (name, email, phone)
- File contents or metadata
- Browsing history
- Location data beyond what's necessary for connections
- Any persistent user identifiers

## How We Use Your Information

### Service Provision
- Establishing P2P connections between devices
- Generating unique sharing codes
- Debugging connection issues

### Legal Compliance

## Data Retention

### Automatic Deletion
- **Session Data**: Deleted immediately after transfer completion
- **Connection Logs**: Purged within 24 hours
- **Error Logs**: Retained for 7 days maximum for debugging
- **Analytics**: No persistent analytics data collected

### No Long-term Storage
We don't maintain any long-term databases of user activity or file transfer history.

## Data Sharing

### We Don't Share Your Data
- No data sales to third parties
- No marketing partnerships involving your data
- No data sharing with advertisers

### Limited Exceptions
We may disclose information only when:
- Required by law (court orders, subpoenas)
- Necessary to prevent harm or illegal activity
- Protecting our rights and property

Even in these cases, we have minimal data to share due to our privacy-first design.

## Your Rights

### Data Control
- **Access**: Request information about data we have (usually none)
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of any stored data
- **Portability**: Download any data we have about you

## Cookies and Tracking

### No Tracking Cookies

### Essential Cookies Only
We use minimal session cookies only for:
- Maintaining your connection during file transfer
- Remembering your preferences (theme, language)
- Preventing abuse and ensuring security

### Third-Party Services
We use minimal third-party services, all privacy-focused:
- **Cloudflare**: For DDoS protection and performance (privacy-compliant)
- **Error Monitoring**: For debugging (no personal data included)

## International Data Transfers

### Minimal Cross-Border Data
Since we don't store files and minimize data collection, international transfers are limited to:
- Basic connection establishment data
- Error logs for debugging

### Safeguards
When data crosses borders, we ensure:
- Adequate protection levels
- Contractual safeguards with service providers
- Compliance with applicable privacy laws
